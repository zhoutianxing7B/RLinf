Modern RL workloads for large language models, long-horizon reasoning, and
agentic systems are highly dynamic: heavy-tailed rollouts, irregular multi-turn
tool interactions, and time-varying bottlenecks leave static GPU partitions idle
and prolong training.

**DynaRL** is the first RL system that dynamically reallocates computation,
memory, and communication across heterogeneous RL components. It models the
entire RL pipeline as a dynamic hypergraph that serves as a centralized,
continuously evolving control surface. With a unified resource-migration
interface and context-aware data routing, the scheduler moves GPUs from
overprovisioned components to the current bottleneck through multi-level
scheduling and fine-grained migration.

DynaRL is implemented atop RLinf and integrates with existing inference engines
(e.g., SGLang) and training backends (e.g., Megatron-LM). It is the system behind
RLinf's :doc:`dynamic scheduling <../../guides/dynamic_scheduling>` feature.

Results
-------

Evaluations on math-reasoning and multi-turn agentic RL (models from 1.5B to
32B) show:

- **Math-reasoning RL:** up to **1.98×** end-to-end throughput over state-of-the-art
  systems (verl, RLinf) across cluster scales.
- **Agentic RL:** **1.06×–1.53×** higher throughput than RLinf; with
  priority-aware request scheduling, **1.27×–1.64×**.
- **Overhead:** scheduling plans within 200 ms; each reallocation in 0.5–5 s;
  online scheduling overhead below **1%**.

Math-reasoning RL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Math-reasoning RL comprises rollout, inference, and training stages. Baseline
systems use static sequential allocation (all GPUs for one stage at a time).
DynaRL detects underutilized stages and reallocates capacity to the active
bottleneck.

Multi-turn agentic RL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Agentic RL has multi-turn rollouts with tool calls, which make load less
predictable. DynaRL combines dynamic GPU allocation with priority-aware request
scheduling (preferring requests with more completed tool calls to reduce
stragglers and improve KV-cache reuse).

GPU allocation timeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The figures below show how 64 GPUs are assigned to Trainer, Rollout, and
Inference over time under three modes: static allocation, dynamic allocation,
and dynamic allocation with priority-aware request scheduling.

Scheduling overhead
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trainer migration cost scales mainly with model size (sub-ms for 1.5B to a few
seconds for 32B) and stays under **0.5%** of end-to-end latency even for 32B on
128 GPUs. Rollout migration completes within a few seconds. Scheduling decisions
finish within **200 ms**; total scheduling overhead per iteration is below
**0.5%**.
