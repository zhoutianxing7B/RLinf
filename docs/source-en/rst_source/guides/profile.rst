Profiling
==============================

RLinf offers two complementary tools for understanding performance, aimed at
different levels:

- **GPU profiling** (``cluster.profiling``): low-level, system profiling of
  *individual* worker processes. It wraps selected worker groups with a
  backend-specific profiler (``nsys``/``rocprof-sys``) to capture CUDA kernels,
  memory traffic, NVTX ranges, and CPU activity. Use it to answer "what is one
  GPU/process doing, kernel by kernel?".
- **Tracing** (``cluster.tracer``): a lightweight, high-level timeline of RLinf's
  own timed sections *across all workers and the runner* — steps, phases, and
  worker RPCs such as ``generate``, ``run_training``, and ``interact``. It has
  negligible overhead and answers "how do the stages across workers overlap, and
  where is the critical path?". See `Tracing`_ below.

The two are independent and can be enabled together. The rest of this page
covers GPU profiling; see `Tracing`_ at the end for tracing.

RLinf supports wrapping selected worker groups with a backend-specific profiler
command. The backend is selected by the required ``backend`` field:

- ``nsight`` — NVIDIA Nsight Systems (``nsys profile``)
- ``rocprof_sys`` — AMD ROCm Systems Profiler (``rocprof-sys-python``)

All backends share the same common fields (``enabled``, ``worker_groups``,
``steps``, ``output_dir``). Backend-specific options live under their own keys.


How To Enable It
------------------------------

Add the profiling preset to ``defaults`` in your YAML:

.. code-block:: yaml

   defaults:
     - hybrid_engines/fsdp@actor.fsdp_config
     - weight_syncer/patch_syncer@weight_syncer
     - profile/default@cluster.profiling

The corresponding config file is ``examples/embodiment/config/profile/default.yaml``.
To switch backends, override ``cluster.profiling.backend`` in your main YAML or on
the Hydra CLI (see the backend-specific sections below).


Common Fields
------------------------------

These fields apply to every profiling backend:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 60

   * - Field
     - Default
     - Description
   * - ``backend``
     - *(required)*
     - Profiling backend: ``"nsight"`` or ``"rocprof_sys"``.
   * - ``enabled``
     - ``true``
     - Master switch. Set to ``false`` to disable without removing the config.
   * - ``worker_groups``
     - ``null``
     - List of worker group names to profile. ``null`` means no workers are profiled.
   * - ``steps``
     - ``null``
     - Training step indices to gate profiling around. ``null`` means full worker lifetime.
   * - ``output_dir``
     - *(auto-derived)*
     - Directory for profiling output. When omitted, defaults to ``<log_path>/<experiment_name>/profiling/``.


The ``enabled`` Flag
------------------------------

.. code-block:: yaml

   cluster:
     profiling:
       backend: nsight
       enabled: false

When ``enabled: false``:

- Workers are not wrapped with a profiler command.
- No output directory is created.
- The rest of the config can stay in place for later reuse.


Output Directory
------------------------------

By default, reports are written under:

.. code-block:: text

   runner.logger.log_path/runner.logger.experiment_name/profiling/

For example:

.. code-block:: text

   ../results/libero_spatial_ppo_openpi/profiling/

To override, set ``output_dir`` explicitly:

.. code-block:: yaml

   cluster:
     profiling:
       backend: nsight
       output_dir: /mnt/public/profiles/my_run


How To Override Worker Groups
------------------------------

Override ``worker_groups`` directly in the main YAML:

.. code-block:: yaml

   cluster:
     profiling:
       backend: nsight
       worker_groups: [ActorGroup, RolloutGroup]

If ``worker_groups`` is omitted or ``null``, no worker is profiled. To profile
all workers in a run, list the names of every worker group you care about.

One subtle point: ``ChannelWorker`` instances are not children of
``ActorGroup`` or ``RolloutGroup`` ranks. ``Channel.create(name)`` launches a
separate worker group whose group name is usually ``Env``, ``Rollout``, or
``Actor``. Profiling ``ActorGroup`` does not automatically include the ``Actor``
channel worker. Add those channel group names explicitly if you want channel-side
traces.

For the built-in embodied runners:

- ``ActorGroup``: actor compute workers
- ``RolloutGroup``: rollout compute workers
- ``EnvGroup``: environment compute workers
- ``Actor``: the channel worker behind ``Channel.create("Actor")``
- ``Rollout``: the channel worker behind ``Channel.create("Rollout")``
- ``Env``: the channel worker behind ``Channel.create("Env")``


How To Profile Only Specific Training Steps
-------------------------------------------

By default, profiling covers the entire worker lifetime. ``steps`` restricts
collection to specific training steps:

.. code-block:: yaml

   cluster:
     profiling:
       backend: nsight
       enabled: true
       steps: [3]            # only profile global step 3

Multiple steps:

.. code-block:: yaml

   cluster:
     profiling:
       steps: [3, 10, 50]

Hydra CLI:

.. code-block:: bash

   python ... '+cluster.profiling.steps=[3]'

When ``steps`` is set:

- For the ``nsight`` backend, RLinf automatically injects
  ``capture-range=cudaProfilerApi`` and ``capture-range-end=stop`` into
  ``options``.
- The embodied runner calls ``torch.cuda.profiler.start()`` before each listed
  step and ``torch.cuda.profiler.stop()`` after it.
- The resulting trace covers only those steps.


NVIDIA: Nsight Systems (``backend: nsight``)
---------------------------------------------

Default Preset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The built-in ``profile/default`` preset looks like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

   backend: nsight
   enabled: true
   worker_groups: [ActorGroup, RolloutGroup, EnvGroup, Actor, Rollout, Env]
   options:
     t: cuda,cudnn,cublas,nvtx,osrt
     sample: process-tree
     cpuctxsw: process-tree
     cudabacktrace: all
     osrt-threshold: 1000
   flags: []

Overriding ``nsys profile`` Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``options`` maps to ``nsys profile`` flags that take values; ``flags`` emits
bare flags:

.. code-block:: yaml

   cluster:
     profiling:
       backend: nsight
       options:
         t: cuda,cudnn,cublas,nvtx,osrt
         sample: process-tree
         backtrace: fp
         capture-range: cudaProfilerApi
         capture-range-end: stop
       flags: [python-backtrace]

Rendering rules:

- Single-character keys → ``-t cuda,...``
- Multi-character keys → ``--backtrace=fp``
- ``flags`` entries → ``--python-backtrace``

Useful options:

- ``t``: traced APIs (``cuda``, ``cudnn``, ``cublas``, ``nvtx``, ``osrt``)
- ``sample``: CPU sampling mode
- ``backtrace``: CPU backtrace method (``lbr``, ``fp``, ``dwarf``)
- ``cpuctxsw``: CPU thread scheduling trace
- ``cudabacktrace``: CUDA API backtraces (adds overhead)
- ``capture-range`` / ``capture-range-end``: scope collection to NVTX or CUDA profiler API ranges

Compute-Path NVTX Annotations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RLinf decorates the hot path of actor, rollout, and env workers with
``@Worker.timer("...")``. The decorator records RLinf timer metrics and opens an
accelerator-specific profiling range through ``AcceleratorUtil.profiling_range``.
For the ``nsight`` backend these ranges appear as labelled NVTX intervals in the
timeline and in ``nsys stats --report nvtx_sum``.

The profiling range is emitted only while a profiling window is active. When
profiling is off, ``Worker.timer`` still records timing metrics and the
accelerator profiling range falls back to a no-op.

Built-in annotations:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 25 50

   * - Worker group
     - NVTX label
     - What it covers
   * - Actor
     - ``actor/recv_traj``
     - Receiving a trajectory batch from the rollout / env side
   * - Actor
     - ``actor/compute_adv``
     - Advantage / return computation
   * - Actor
     - ``actor/run_training``
     - Policy / value optimization step (forward + backward + optimizer)
   * - Actor
     - ``actor/sync_model_to_rollout``
     - Weight broadcast from actor to rollout workers
   * - Rollout
     - ``rollout/recv_obs``
     - Pulling observations from the env channel
   * - Rollout
     - ``rollout/predict``
     - Single-step policy forward pass
   * - Rollout
     - ``rollout/generate``
     - Multi-step generation / unroll
   * - Rollout
     - ``rollout/generate_epoch``
     - A full rollout epoch
   * - Rollout
     - ``rollout/send_actions``
     - Sending actions back to env workers
   * - Rollout
     - ``rollout/send_traj``
     - Shipping completed trajectories to the actor side
   * - Rollout (async)
     - ``rollout/poll_weight_sync`` / ``rollout/request_weight_sync``
     - Async weight-sync handshake with the actor
   * - Env
     - ``env/recv_actions``
     - Receiving the next-action batch from the rollout side
   * - Env
     - ``env/step`` / ``env/bootstrap_step``
     - One simulator step (and the warm-up step at episode start)
   * - Env
     - ``env/interact`` / ``env/interact_once``
     - The full env interaction loop (and a single sub-iteration of it)
   * - Env
     - ``env/send_obs`` / ``env/send_rollout_trajectories``
     - Pushing observations / completed rollouts downstream

Decorating your own worker method:

.. code-block:: python

   from rlinf.scheduler.worker import Worker

   class MyWorker(Worker):
       @Worker.timer("my_worker/my_phase")
       def my_phase(self, batch):
           ...

Ad-Hoc Profiling Ranges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For one-off in-function annotations:

.. code-block:: python

   from rlinf.scheduler.hardware import AcceleratorUtil

   class MyWorker(Worker):
       def my_phase(self, batch):
           with AcceleratorUtil.profiling_range(
               self._accelerator_type, "my_worker/inner_phase"
           ):
               run_inner_phase(batch)

``AcceleratorUtil.profiling_range`` dispatches to the current accelerator
backend. It is a no-op when the accelerator has no registered profiling range
implementation or when profiling is not active.


AMD: ROCm Systems Profiler (``backend: rocprof_sys``)
-------------------------------------------------------

Minimal Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configure ``rocprof_sys`` inline in your run config:

.. code-block:: yaml

   backend: rocprof_sys
   enabled: true
   worker_groups: [ActorGroup, RolloutGroup, EnvGroup]
   args:
     T: hip           # trace HIP API calls

RLinf wraps each matching worker's Python interpreter with:

.. code-block:: text

   rocprof-sys-python [args] -- <python_interpreter>

Overriding ``rocprof-sys-python`` Arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``args`` maps to ``rocprof-sys-python`` flags that take values:

.. code-block:: yaml

   cluster:
     profiling:
       backend: rocprof_sys
       args:
         T: hip,hsa,rccl     # single-char key → -T hip,hsa,rccl
         output-format: json  # multi-char key  → --output-format=json

Rendering rules:

- Single-character keys → ``-T hip,hsa,rccl``
- Multi-character keys → ``--output-format=json``

Injecting Environment Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use ``env`` to pass extra environment variables to profiled workers:

.. code-block:: yaml

   cluster:
     profiling:
       backend: rocprof_sys
       env:
         ROCPROFSYS_SAMPLING_FREQ: "100"

RLinf automatically derives ``ROCPROFSYS_OUTPUT_PATH`` and
``ROCPROFSYS_OUTPUT_PREFIX`` from ``output_dir``; values provided in ``env``
take precedence.

Recommended Workflow
------------------------------

NVIDIA first pass:

- Start with ``profile/default@cluster.profiling``.
- Keep ``enabled: true`` and use the preset as-is for both CUDA-side and CPU
  runtime visibility.
- Avoid ``capture-range: nvtx`` until you have confirmed the target workers
  emit NVTX ranges.
- Use ``steps: [3]`` to limit trace size on long runs.

AMD first pass:

- Configure ``rocprof_sys`` inline:

  .. code-block:: yaml

     cluster:
       profiling:
         backend: rocprof_sys
         enabled: true
         worker_groups: [ActorGroup, RolloutGroup, EnvGroup]
         args:
           T: hip

- Verify ``rocprof-sys-python`` is on ``PATH`` in each worker's environment.
- Check ``output_dir`` for ``.json`` or binary trace files after the run.


Tracing
------------------------------

Whereas GPU profiling zooms into one process, tracing gives the big picture: it
records the execution timeline of RLinf's own timed sections across the runner
and all Ray workers (environment, rollout, actor, etc.), and exports it in the
Chrome Trace format for interactive visualization. It has negligible overhead and
is the fastest way to see how stages overlap and where the critical path is.

How It Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. When tracing is enabled, the cluster launches the **tracer**, a scheduler
   manager (a single Ray actor on node rank 0), alongside the other managers
   (``WorkerManager``, ``NodeManager``, …) at startup.
2. Every worker and the driver reach it autonomously via ``Tracer.get_proxy()``,
   exactly like the other managers — there is no per-process client, buffer, or
   background thread.
3. Every timed section — the runner's ``ScopedTimer`` sections (e.g. ``step``,
   ``generate_rollouts``) and workers' ``Worker.timer`` sections (e.g.
   ``run_training``, ``interact``, ``predict``) — emits a trace event that is sent
   directly to the tracer manager, which appends it to a JSONL trace file.

Enabling Tracing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because the tracer is a cluster manager, it is configured under ``cluster.tracer``;
no separate server process needs to be started:

.. code-block:: yaml

   cluster:
     tracer:
       enable: true
       output_file: null    # defaults to <log_path>/<experiment_name>/trace/trace_events.jsonl

Or directly from the Hydra CLI:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 examples/embodiment/train_embodied_agent.py \
        --config-name libero_spatial_ppo_openpi_pi05 \
        +cluster.tracer.enable=true

When ``output_file`` is not set, trace events are written to
``runner.logger.log_path/runner.logger.experiment_name/trace/trace_events.jsonl``
on node rank 0.

Adding Custom Spans
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Timed sections are traced automatically. In workers, ``@Worker.timer(...)`` and
``with self.worker_timer(...)`` emit trace events by default; pass
``trace=False`` to opt a timer out of tracing. For trace-only instrumentation,
``Tracer`` exposes ``trace_begin`` / ``trace_end``, the ``trace_span`` context
manager, and the ``trace_func`` decorator:

.. code-block:: python

   from rlinf.scheduler import Tracer

   with Tracer.trace_span("data_preprocess", cat="actor"):
       preprocess()

All tracing APIs are no-ops when tracing is disabled, so they are safe to leave
in code paths that also run without tracing.

Visualizing Traces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once your run completes or during execution, you can visualize the trace data:

1. Locate the output JSONL file (e.g., ``trace_events.jsonl``).
2. Use ``jq`` to convert the JSON Lines format into a single JSON array
   (Perfetto requires this):

   .. code-block:: bash

       jq -s . trace_events.jsonl > trace_events.json

3. Open a Chrome-based browser and navigate to
   `Perfetto UI <https://ui.perfetto.dev/>`_ or ``chrome://tracing``.
4. Click **Open trace file** and select your converted ``trace_events.json``
   file.

You will see an interactive Gantt chart visualizing execution layers, actor
wait times, and system bottlenecks, with each process labeled by its worker name
(e.g. ``ActorGroup:0``) or ``driver``.
